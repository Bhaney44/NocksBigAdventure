#Relevant Ideas:  
Use of Canvas and Runnable to create a game loop the constantly updates with each frame  
Creation of a full screen program that is scaled to any resolution using java's Toolkit  
Use of enumerators to set game "states" and render a menu, pause screen, etc. based on the current state  
Use of BufferStrategy and Graphics to perform actual game rendering  
Practice with memory allocation using garbage collection to allow the game to perform at default heap size
